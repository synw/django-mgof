# Private forums

The forums can be:

- Public
- Reserved to logged in users
- Reserved to groups

Enable the private forums in settings: `MGOF_ENABLE_PRIVATE_FORUMS = True` or it will not work.

Note: Mgof ships with lightweight queries by default to be fast. As private forums require more complex queries
you have to explicitly enable it.

Use the admin interface to set forum permissions.
